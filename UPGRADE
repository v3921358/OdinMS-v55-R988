Upgrading from 0.5
==================

You DO NOT have to wipe your existing database when upgrading.

1. Copy the following files from the distribution into your existing directory and overwrite
already existing files:
	dist/exttools.jar
	dist/odinms.jar
	scripts/npc/*
	sendops.properties
2. Add the following lines to your world.properties file:
	# time in milliseconds between ranking updates (default: 30 minutes)
	net.sf.odinms.login.ranking.interval=1800000
3. Execute the DatabaseUpdater tool. It will automagically detect which changes have 
to be made in your database.
The update.bat/update.sh file contains an example on how to run it.
Make sure that your db.properties file is in the same directory as the update.bat/.sh file.


Upgrading from SVN revisions after 0.5
======================================

If you already updated to a revision from the subversion repository
you should follow the same procedure. The database update will detect
which changes already happened.
Please note: The SVN repository contains the most recent development code
it may have not been tested on a production system yet.
For a stable environment we recommend you to use the latest release. We
can't give you any support with intermediate SVN versions.
